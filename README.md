This is a Spotify web-app copy built with React, CSS and TypeScript. For now, it's only the home page without playback controls but I'm still working on the rest of the components :). It connects directly to your Spotify account so you will be looking at your playlists, liked songs, albums and recently played stuff once you login! All of it is possible through the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api).


## Initial setup
In order to see this project in your browser you need to follow the next steps:

1. Clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tottipensotti/spotify-clone.git
``` 
3. Make sure you have NodeJs installed in your computer, if not, download the installer from Node.js official page. To make sure it's installed run this command in your terminal
```bash
node -v
```
4. Now, you need to install all the dependencies with
```bash
npm install
```
6. Finally, you need to start the app
```bash
npm run start
```

## Now the fun part!
First, you're going to see a login screen, you need to access with your Spotify account

Then, you can navigate through the home page! As I mentioned, I'm still working in the playback functionalities and albums/artists/playlists section
